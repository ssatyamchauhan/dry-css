            <h1>Create-React-App Continuous Integration</h1>
            <h2>Everybody writes code, what is your difference as a pro</h2>
            <p>
                Automation has a key role here. Thanks to agile methodology, it brings us tons of tools to automate the
                processes. There are lots of things to talk about this. But to cut a long story short, I’ll start to
                talk about this post’s main goal.
                This post is about continuous integration of create-react-app application. I’ll create a front-end
                continuous integration with CircleCI and introduce some tools that will help our flow. This will be a
                pretty long post, titles of the post can provide you insight about the content.

            <h1>New CRA application</h1>
            <h2>Surely the first thing to do is creating a react app</h2>

                CircleCI is one of CI tools at the market. It has a cloud option and a great pricing strategy for
                newcomers.
                Now you need a config.yml file inside a .circleci folder at the project’s root. Your projects root
                should be like below.

            <h1>Static Analysis with ESLint</h1>
            <h2>We are using circleci config version 2.1.</h2>
            <p>
                Linting is a crucial part of frontend projects freely how great developers your team has. Our CI should
                catch syntax errors and suspicious patterns.
                Create-React-App is coming with ESLint and it’s own rules. No need to install anything. We should only
                create the configuration. Firstly we’ll create a new script command. Scripts part of our package.json
                should look like this.
